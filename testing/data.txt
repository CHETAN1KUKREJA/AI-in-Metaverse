  - Example: *"Consider the following options step by step, evaluate each, and explain your reasoning."*

#### **Self-Reflection Prompts**:
- Encourage the model to evaluate its own decisions:
  - *"Why did you choose this option? How will this impact the environment?"*

#### **Conditional Prompts**:
- Use conditional structures to help the LLM handle ambiguous situations:
  - *"If option A seems viable, explain why. If not, choose the next best alternative and justify your choice."*

#### **Function Calling Prompts**:
- Format outputs to trigger specific actions in Godot.
  - Example: *"Respond in JSON format with {action: 'interact', object: 'door'} or {action: 'think', reason: 'uncertain which path to take'}."*

- Employ event-driven interaction models, where agents react to specific game events.

#### **Hierarchical Goal Management**:
- Use tools like **LangChain Chains** or tree-like data structures to handle goals and subgoals.
- Framework: **PyPlanning** for hierarchical task planning.

#### **Time Awareness**:
- Add a time-tracking mechanism and represent temporal constraints in prompts.
