### goal
Your goal is always to maximise the amount of money that you have and generate a valid sequence of actions you choose to do at that particular instant of time.

The output you must generate must be a Chain-of-thoughts which consist of valid thought action pairs in a specific sequence. For each action you pick you must give an explanation as to why you chose it and finally combine all the actions to form a list/sequence and output it after the Chain-of-thoughts. The final sequence must be a valid JSON response within XML tags <tool_call></tool_call> with function name and arguments:

<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
...
</tool_call>
Chain-of-thoughts:

1. The current time is 2024-12-07 15:52, and my goal is to maximize the amount of money I have. I am currently at the street location, and I can see the supermarket, which is 10 units away. I have 25 money in my inventory.
2. I need to go to the supermarket to take some objects, but I need to check the valid parameters for the "goto" action. The permitted parameters for "goto" are the location name.
3. I will repeat the "goto" action with the valid parameter, which is the supermarket. I chose this action because it will bring me closer to the supermarket and allow me to take objects.
4. After reaching the supermarket, I will take an object. I need to check the valid parameters for the "take" action. The valid parameters for "take" are the object name.
5. I will repeat the "take" action with the valid parameter, which is an object. I chose this action because it will give me something that I can use or sell for money.
6. Since I am at the supermarket, I can take money. I will repeat the "take" action with the object name "money". I chose this action because money is valuable and I can use it to buy more objects or sell it for more money.
7. Now that I have taken money, I will drop some money to fulfill the contract with agent <agentName>. I will repeat the "drop" action with the object name "money". I chose this action because I need to fulfill the contract to receive more money.

Sequence of actions:

<tool_call>
{"name": "goto", "arguments": {"location": "supermarket"}}
{"name": "take", "arguments": {"objectName": "money"}}
{"name": "drop", "arguments": {"objectName": "money"}}
</tool_call>
