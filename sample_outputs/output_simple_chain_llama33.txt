That's all the information you know for now. If you need information from other agents, you should ask them and wait them to reply. You are not allowed to assume anything yourself.

### goal
Your goal is always to maximise the amount of money that you have and generate a valid sequence of actions you choose to do at that particular instant of time.

The output you must generate must be a Chain-of-thoughts which consist of valid thought action pairs in a specific sequence. For each action you pick you must give an explanation as to why you chose it and finally combine all the actions to form a list/sequence and output it after the Chain-of-thoughts. The final sequence must be a valid JSON response within XML tags <tool_call></tool_call> with function name and arguments:

<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
</tool_call>
To maximize the amount of money I have, I need to consider my current status and the contracts I'm engaged in. I have a contract with another agent where I receive 5 money every iteration and give 2 apples in return. Since my current hunger level is 3, I should prioritize actions that will help me maintain or improve my health and happiness while also fulfilling my contractual obligations and increasing my wealth.

1. **Assess Current Status**: I have 25 money, 1 apple, and I'm currently on my way to the library (50% completed). My health is at 10, hunger at 3, and happiness at 5.

2. **Contractual Obligations**: I need to give 2 apples to the other agent every iteration. However, I only have 1 apple, so I need to acquire at least one more apple to fulfill my obligation.

3. **Action Planning**:
    - **Acquire More Apples**: The closest location where I can get apples is the forest, but it's 40 units away. Considering my current action is going to the library, which is closer, I should complete that action first.
    - **Complete Current Action**: Finish going to the library. This might provide opportunities to take books or drop books, but my primary goal is to complete the action as it's already in progress.
    - **Communicate with Other Agents**: Since there's another agent near me (10 units away), I should try to communicate with them to see if they can provide any assistance or information, especially regarding acquiring more apples or other beneficial items.

4. **Sequence of Actions**:
    - **Finish Going to the Library**: Complete the current action to utilize any potential benefits the library offers.
    - **Talk to the Nearby Agent**: Attempt to communicate with the agent to gather information or negotiate trades that could be beneficial.
    - **Plan for Acquiring Apples**: Decide on the best course of action for getting more apples, whether it's going to the forest or negotiating with other agents.

Given these considerations, the sequence of actions I choose is:

<tool_call>
{"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "library"}}
{"name": "talk", "arguments": {"volume": "normal", "content": "Hello, do you have any apples or know where I can get some?"}}
{"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "forest"}}
</tool_call>

This sequence aims to complete my current action, gather information or assistance from nearby agents, and then proceed to acquire the necessary apples to fulfill my contractual obligations while considering opportunities to increase my wealth.
