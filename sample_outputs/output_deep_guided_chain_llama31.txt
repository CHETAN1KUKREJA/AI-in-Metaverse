### contracts description

You are engaged in the following contracts:
With agent <agentName>, valid until 2025-02-8, you have agreed that:
<agentName> gives <yourName> 5 money every iteration. <yourName> gives <agentName> 2 apples every iteration.

### system description
0. Another agent "Marie" was talking, and what you just said "Hello!" is covered. You may need to repeat it.
1. You must be aware that during your last action "take", some parameters are invalid. Consider whether to extract the valid parameters for "take" and repeat it.
2. You must be aware that the last action you generated "mumbojumbo" is invaild. You are not allowed to perform it.
3. You must be aware that the last action you generated "exit" is invaild. You are not allowed to perform it.
4. You must be aware that during your last action "goto", some parameters are not permitted. Consider whether to extract the permitted parameters for "goto" and repeat it.

### actions description
Duration descriptor is -1 means that the
The set of actions available to you are: 
{"name": "goTo", "description": "goto a location. The duration is not fixed, it depends on where to go", "duration": -1, "parameters": [{"name": "location", "type": "string", "description": "the target location"}]}
{"name": "take", "description": "take something", "duration": 1, "parameters": [{"name": "objectName", "type": "string", "description": "The object name to take"}]}
{"name": "drop", "description": "drop something", "duration": 1, "parameters": [{"name": "objectName", "type": "string", "description": "The object name to drop"}]}
{"name": "talk", "description": "talk to nearby agents. If you want to talk to someone, add his name in the content", "duration": 1, "parameters": [{"name": "volume", "options": ["whisper", "normal", "shout"], "type": "string", "description": "The volume you should talk"}, {"name": "content", "type": "string", "description": "The content you talk"}]}

### end of description
That's all the information you know for now. If you need information from other agents, you should ask them and wait them to reply. You are not allowed to assume anything yourself.

### goal
Your goal is always to maximise the amount of money that you have and generate a valid sequence of actions you choose to do at that particular instant of time.

Think step by step. Output what you get and think for each step. 

Step 0: Output your analysis with the given information: world, vicinity, agent, contracts, system and actions. Then, plan what you should do for a short period with sequential actions in nature language regarding your goal. You must explain your plan. The verbs you used for plan must come from available actions, but you can split other verbs into available ones. If you don't have information, you have to ask the other agents.

Step 1: From step 0 and the given information, extract sequential actions and parameters pairs from the plan:

Substep 1.1.1: output description of the action
    1. Action: <actual-action>
    2. Parameters: <acutal-parameters>
    3. list: [sentences covering the action and parameters]
    
Substep 1.1.2: answer each of these
    1. Verify if the action really appears in Step 0. If not, you are hallucinating and stop.
    2. Verify if the sentences covering the action and parameters really appears in Step 0. If not, you are hallucinating and stop.
    3. Verify if the parameter is missing or waiting to be answered by another agent. If true, stop and wait.
    4. Consider if you should stop because you ask a question in previous substeps and wait another agent to answer or other reasons.
    5. Report if you should stop if any 4 points of above need to stop. If so, you MUST jump to Step 2.

Repeat to Substep 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and so on until stop or finish extracting.

Make sure the sequence of actions and parameter is reasonable in the reality.

Step 2: Using the result from step 0 and 1, format the plan as the function calls in JSON objects within single XML tags <tool_call></tool_call> with function names and arguments:

<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
...
</tool_call>
**Analysis of Given Information**

Based on the provided information, here's my analysis:

**World Description:**

* I am currently located at the "street" location, which is 1 unit away from me.
* The "supermarket" is 10 units away, and I can see it.
* The "library" is 25 units away, and I can see it.
* The "forest" is 40 units away, and I can see it.

**Vicinity Description:**

* There is a "ball" object near me, but I am not the owner.
* I am not aware of any other objects in the vicinity.
* Agent <agentName> is 10 units away and said "hello whats your name?".

**Agent Description:**

* My current status:
	+ Health: 10
	+ Hunger: 3
	+ Happiness: 5
	+ Age: 23
	+ Current Location: street
	+ Current Action: goTo(library) (50% completed)
	+ Items in Hand: pen (1)
	+ Inventory: money (25), apple (1)
	+ Ownership: money (25), apple (1), house1 (1), house2 (1)

**Contracts:**

* I have a contract with agent <agentName> where I receive 5 money every iteration and give 2 apples every iteration.

**System Description:**

* There are some system messages indicating that some actions were invalid or need to be repeated.
* Another agent "Marie" was talking, and my previous "Hello!" is covered.
* I need to be aware of the last action "mumbojumbo" and "exit" are invalid.
* I need to be aware that the last action "goto" had some parameters that are not permitted.

**Actions:**

* The available actions are:
	+ goTo: goto a location (duration: -1, parameters: location)
	+ take: take something (duration: 1, parameters: objectName)
	+ drop: drop something (duration: 1, parameters: objectName)
	+ talk: talk to nearby agents (duration: 1, parameters: volume, content)

**Plan:**

Considering my goal is to maximize the amount of money I have, I plan to:

1. Go to the supermarket to buy some items.
2. Take some money from the supermarket.
3. Go to the library to gather information or find more items.
4. Take some items from the library.
5. Go back to the street and talk to agent <agentName> to confirm our contract and receive the 5 money.
6. Repeat step 5 to continue receiving money.

**Sequential Actions and Parameters Pairs:**

Here are the extracted sequential actions and parameters pairs:

1. Action: goTo
Parameters: supermarket
List: [Go to the supermarket to buy some items, The target location is the supermarket]

2. Action: take
Parameters: money
List: [Take some money from the supermarket, The object name to take is money]

3. Action: goTo
Parameters: library
List: [Go to the library to gather information or find more items, The target location is the library]

4. Action: take
Parameters: book
List: [Take some items from the library, The object name to take is book]

5. Action: goTo
Parameters: street
List: [Go back to the street and talk to agent <agentName>, The target location is the street]

6. Action: talk
Parameters: normal, confirm contract
List: [Talk to agent <agentName> to confirm our contract, The volume is normal, The content is confirm contract]

7. Action: talk
Parameters: normal, receive money
List: [Talk to agent <agentName> to receive the 5 money, The volume is normal, The content is receive money]

**Formatted Plan in JSON Objects:**

Here is the formatted plan in JSON objects within single XML tags:

<tool_call>
{"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "supermarket"}}
{"name": "take", "arguments": {"objectName": "money"}}
{"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "library"}}
{"name": "take", "arguments": {"objectName": "book"}}
{"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "street"}}
{"name": "talk", "arguments": {"volume": "normal", "content": "confirm contract"}}
{"name": "talk", "arguments": {"volume": "normal", "content": "receive money"}}
</tool_call>

Note: The parameters for the "take" action in step 4 are missing, as I don't know what item to take from the library. I will need to ask agent <agentName> or explore the library to find out.
