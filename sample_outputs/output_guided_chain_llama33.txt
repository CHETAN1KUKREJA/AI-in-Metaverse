you are an LLM agent that is supposed to act like a human character in a virtual environment. you are given some set of actions and your job is to choose the most relevant sequence of actions in order to carry out a task in the environment.

### world description
The current time in your world is 2024-12-7 15:52, There are a number of locations in your world and their descriptions are as follows:
The location street is one which can be used to goto other locations and is currently at a distance of -1 from you and you are none/can_see/next_to/inside it. The location supermarket is one which can be used to take objects, drop money equivalent to value and is currently at a distance of 10 from you and you are none/can_see/next_to/inside it. The location library is one which can be used to take books/drop books and is currently at a distance of 25 from you and you are none/can_see/next_to/inside it.

<agentName> gives <yourName> 5 money every iteration. <yourName> gives <agentName> 2 apples every iteration.

### system description
0. Another agent "Marie" was talking, and what you just said "Hello!" is covered. You may need to repeat it.
1. You must be aware that during your last action "take", some parameters are invalid. Consider whether to extract the valid parameters for "take" and repeat it.
2. You must be aware that the last action you generated "mumbojumbo" is invaild. You are not allowed to perform it.
3. You must be aware that the last action you generated "exit" is invaild. You are not allowed to perform it.

The set of actions available to you are: 
{"name": "goTo", "description": "goto a location. The duration is not fixed, it depends on where to go", "duration": -1, "parameters": [{"name": "location", "type": "string", "description": "the target location"}]}
{"name": "take", "description": "take something", "duration": 1, "parameters": [{"name": "objectName", "type": "string", "description": "The object name to take"}]}
{"name": "drop", "description": "drop something", "duration": 1, "parameters": [{"name": "objectName", "type": "string", "description": "The object name to drop"}]}
{"name": "talk", "description": "talk to nearby agents. If you want to talk to someone, add his name in the content", "duration": 1, "parameters": [{"name": "volume", "options": ["whisper", "normal", "shout"], "type": "string", "description": "The volume you should talk"}, {"name": "content", "type": "string", "description": "The content you talk"}]}

### end of description
That's all the information you know for now. If you need information from other agents, you should ask them and wait them to reply. You are not allowed to assume anything yourself.

### goal
Your goal is always to maximise the amount of money that you have and generate a valid sequence of actions you choose to do at that particular instant of time.

Think step by step. Output what you get and think for each step.

Step 0: Analysis with the given information: world, vicinity, agent, contracts, system and actions. Then, plan what you should do for a short period in nature language regarding your goal. Always ask yourself if the plan can be executed using the actions provided. If you don't have information, you have to ask the other agents. You must give an explanation as for the plan.

Step 1: Identify the sequential key actions that are relevant to tool functions and the goal as a list. You must give an explanation as to why you chose the actions. Everytime you identify a key action, extract the required parameters or genreate contents for parameters that matches the context. You must also explain why you select those parameters

Step 2: Using the result from step 1 and 2, format ALL the function calls as JSON objects within XML tags <tool_call></tool_call> with function name and arguments:

<tool_call>
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
{"name": <function-name>(, "arguments": <args-json-object>)}
</tool_call>
### Step 0: Analysis with the given information

From the provided information, we understand the following key points:

1. **Current Status**: We have a health of 10, hunger of 3, happiness of 5, and we are 23 years old. We are currently located on the "street".
2. **Inventory and Ownership**: We have a pen in hand, an inventory consisting of money (25 units) and an apple, and we own two houses (house1 and house2).
3. **Contracts**: We are engaged in a contract with another agent where we receive 5 money every iteration and give 2 apples in return.
4. **Available Actions**: We can perform actions like "goTo" (to move to different locations), "take" (to pick up objects), "drop" (to drop objects), and "talk" (to communicate with nearby agents).
5. **Goal**: Our primary objective is to maximize the amount of money we have.

Given our current situation and the goal, our immediate plan should focus on addressing our hunger (since it's at 3) and exploring ways to increase our wealth. 

Since we are currently on the "street" and our hunger is at 3, it might be beneficial to head towards the "supermarket" to acquire food, which could potentially increase our hunger satisfaction. However, we should also consider the distance to the supermarket (10 units away) and the fact that we are already in the process of going to the library (50% completed). It might be more efficient to complete our current action before diverting to the supermarket.

Additionally, interacting with the agent 10 units away from us could provide opportunities for trade or other beneficial interactions, given we have a contract that involves exchanging goods (apples for money).

### Step 1: Identify sequential key actions

Based on our analysis, the key actions could be:
1. **Complete the current action of going to the library**: Since we are already 50% into this action, it might be more efficient to complete it before starting a new one.
2. **Address hunger**: This could involve going to the supermarket to acquire food. However, we need to consider the cost and the distance.
3. **Interact with the nearby agent**: Given the contract we have, interacting with other agents could lead to opportunities for gaining more money or resources.

For the action of going to the library, the required parameter is the location, which is "library".

For addressing hunger, if we decide to go to the supermarket, the action would be "goTo" with the location parameter being "supermarket".

For interacting with the nearby agent, we could use the "talk" action. The parameters for this action would include the volume (let's choose "normal" for a standard conversation) and the content (we could say "hello" to initiate a conversation).

### Step 2: Format function calls as JSON objects within XML tags

```xml
<tool_call>
    {"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "library"}}
    {"name": "goTo", "arguments": {"location": "supermarket"}}
    {"name": "talk", "arguments": {"volume": "normal", "content": "hello"}}
</tool_call>
```

However, it's crucial to note that we should prioritize these actions based on our current situation and the distances involved. Completing the current action and then reassessing our situation might be the most logical first step. 

Therefore, the immediate next step should focus on completing the "goTo" library action, followed by a reassessment of our situation to decide whether to proceed to the supermarket or interact with the agent, considering the distances and our current needs.
